            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi. Welcome to my website. I am a medical device professional with over 12 years of experience, ranging from research and development to quality assurance and quality systems to information technology.
                I am an avid seeker of knowledge, and I never stop trying to learn new things.
            </p>
            <p>
                I graduated from UCLA in 2010 with a BS in Biochemistry. 
                I immediatley started working in the medical device industry as a R&D scientist in product development. 
                As I spent time learning about the manufacturing process and what it takes to consistently turn out products that people routinely entrust their health and lives to, I became a true believer in the importance of quality assurance and quality systems.
                So I threw myself into the world of regulatory bodies and agencies, as well as constantly monitoring and policing manufacturing practices and processes to understand what are the best practices to put out the best and safest products.  
            </p>
            <P>
                As I continued in my career, I came into more and more contact with software and its impact in the new generation of medical devices. 
                Not only medical devices, but even the use of bioninformatics and pipeline development used to test and diagnose various diseases and genetic conditions.
                I came realize just how importante software development was to the industy, and that it was definitely the next step forward. 
                So now I am working on educating myself in understanding the process behind full stack development and along the way, perhaps apply this not only in the regulatory sense, but as a future software professional.
            </P>
